# Task-4

I sourced the dataset from Kaggle and imported it into Power BI for analysis. The initial phase involved thorough data 
cleaning using Power Query, where I addressed inconsistencies, removed duplicates, and ensured the dataset was properly 
structured and ready for further analysis.

Following the data preparation, I created several DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) 
such as Total Revenue, Average Revenue, Total Number of Countries, and Total Transactions. These measures 
provided a solid foundation for gaining meaningful insights from the data.

Subsequently, I designed an interactive dashboard using a variety of visual elements including bar charts, 
pie charts, line graphs, and slicers. This allowed users to dynamically filter and explore the data, 
enabling deeper and more intuitive insights into business performance across different dimensions 
such as time, geography, and transaction type.
